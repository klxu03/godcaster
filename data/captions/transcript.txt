 I just gotta say the IG yelling from both teams so far has been immaculate. Oh it's been a treat to watch. They've always, it seems like they always pick the right side. First trip cleared, the dog went all the way around the pillar! TenZ does it again! And TenZ on OT! But can they counter? No! TenZ with four! Second gets the last! OT on the cards! That's the Tenz we love. That's vintage Tenz. What is this? Oh my gosh! It's like his bullets just have a magnet on everybody's head. And that was to force OT. I mean, he gets picked there. Map's probably over. Single-handedly takes out three members.
